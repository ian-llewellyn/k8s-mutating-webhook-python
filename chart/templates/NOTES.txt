Congratulations, you have installed the k8s-admission-webhook.
Deployment: {{ include "webhook.fullname" . }}
Namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}

It's usually more convenient to upgrade the helm deployment, but you can adjust
the JSONPatch list on-the-fly by updating the {{ include "webhook.fullname" . }} ConfigMap.

Furthermore, the Pods affected by the webhook can be altered by editing the
namespaceSelector in the MutatingWebhookConfiguration {{ include "webhook.fullname" . }}.

To test the webhook, you can POST the fake AdmissionReview object provided at
https://github.com/ian-llewellyn/k8s-mutating-webhook-python/blob/master/AdmissionReview.json
with the following steps:

# Start a port forward
kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "webhook.fullname" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} 8443:443 &

# Send a fake request
curl -ik -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @AdmissionReview.json \
  https://localhost:8443
